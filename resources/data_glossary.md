# Terms in data science defined in one paragraph

<br>

Although, I am not a big fan of the term "data science" itself  - since it is an umbrella term that basically includes everything but means nothing in particular.  
Here, I probably finally found a context where it is useful: I think it makes this collection eligible to include anything from machine learning and pattern classification, data mining, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and statistics. I basically picture "data science" as the name of the Venn diagram of all those different fields (with extensive overlap!).

I'd be happy about contributions or to hear your comments and suggestions.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="accuracy"></a>
#### Accuracy
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Accuracy is defined as the fraction of correct classifications out of the total number of samples; it resembles one way to assess the performance of a predictor and is often used synonymous to [specificity](#specificity)/[precision](#precision-and-recall) although it is calculated differently. Accuracy is calculated as (TP+TN)/(P+N), where TP=True Positives, TN=True Negatives, P=Positives, N=Negatives.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="active-learning"></a>
#### Active Learning
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Active learning is a variant of the [on-line learning](#on-line-learning) machine learning architecture where feedback about the ground truth class labels of unseen data can be requested if the classification is uncertain. New training data that was labeled can then be used to update the model as in [on-line learning](#on-line-learning).

<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="anomaly-detection"></a>
#### Anomaly detection
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Anomaly detection describes the task of identifying points that deviate from specific patterns in a dataset --  the so-called outliers. Different types of anomaly detection methods include graph-based, statistical-based and distance-based techniques and can be used in both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="artificial-neural-networks-ann"></a>
#### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a class of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the neuron architecture of the human brain. Typically, a (multi-layer) ANN consists of a layer of input nodes, a layer of output nodes, and hidden layers in-between. The nodes are connected by weighted links that can be interpreted as the neuron-connections by axons of different strengths.
The simplest version of an ANN is a single-layer [perceptron](#perceptron).

<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="backtesting"></a>
#### Backtesting
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Backtesting is a specific case of [cross-validation](#cross-validation) in the context of finance and trading models where empirical data from previous time periods (data from the past) is used to evaluate a trading strategy.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="bagging"></a>
#### Bagging
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Bagging is an ensemble method for classification (or regression analysis) in which individual models are trained by random sampling of data, and the final decision is made by voting among individual models with equal weights (or averaging for regression analysis).

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="bag-of-words"></a>
#### Bag of words
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Bag of words is a model that is used to construct sparse feature vectors for text classification tasks. The bag of words is an unordered set of all words that occur in all documents that are part of the training set. Every word is then associated with a count of how often it occurs whereas the positional information is ignored. Sometimes, the bag of words is also called "dictionary" or "vocabulary" based on the training data.
<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="batch-gradient-descent"></a>
#### Batch Gradient Descent

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Batch Gradient descent is a variant of a [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent) algorithm to optimize a function by finding its local minimum. In contrast to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](#stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd) the gradient is computed from the whole dataset.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="batch-learning"></a>
#### Batch Learning

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Batch learning is an architecture used in machine learning tasks where the entire training dataset is available upfront to build the model. In contrast to [on-line learning](#on-line-learning), the model is not updated once it was build on a training dataset.

<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="big-data"></a>
#### Big Data
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

There are many different, controversial interpretations and definitions for the term "Big Data". Typically, one refers to data as "Big Data" if its volume and complexity are of a magnitude that the data cannot be processed by "conventional" computing platforms anymore; storage space, processing power, and database structures are typically among the limiting factors.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="bootstrapping"></a>
#### Bootstrapping
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A resampling technique to that is closely related to [cross-validation](#cross-validation) where a training dataset is divided into random subsets. Bootstrapping -- in contrast to cross-validation -- is a random sampling **with** replacement. Bootstrapping is typically used for statistical estimation of bias and standard error, and a common application in machine learning is to estimate the generalization error of a predictor.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="bregman-divergence"></a>
#### Bregman divergence
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Bregman divergence describes are family of proximity functions (or distance measures) that share common properties and are often used in clustering algorithms. A popular example is the squared Euclidean distance.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="central-limit-theorem"></a>
#### Central Limit Theorem
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Central Limit Theorem is a theorem in the field of probability theory that expresses the idea
that the distribution of sample means (from independent random variables) converges to a normal distribution when the sample size approaches infinity.
<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="confusion-matrix"></a>
#### Confusion Matrix
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The confusion matrix is used as a way to represent the performance of a classifier and is sometimes also called "error matrix". This square matrix consists of columns and rows that list the number of instances as absolute or relative "actual class" vs. "predicted class" ratios.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="contingency-table"></a>
#### Contingency Table
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A contingency table is used in clustering analysis to compare the overlap between two different clustering (grouping) results. The partitions from the two clustering results are represented as rows and columns in the table, and the individual elements of the table represent the number of elements that are shared between two partitions from each clustering result.

<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="correlation"></a>
#### Correlation analysis
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Correlation analysis describes and quantifies the relationship between two independent variables. Typically, in case of a positive correlation both variables have a tendency to increase, and in the case of negative correlation, one variable increases while the other variable increases. It is important to mention the famous quotation "correlation does not imply causation".

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="correlation-analysis-canonical"></a>
#### Correlation analysis, Canonical
Let **x** and **y** be two vectors, the goal of canonical correlation analysis is to maximize the correlation between linear transformations of those original vectors. With applications in dimensionality reduction and feature selection, CCA tries to find common dimensions between two vectors.


<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="correlation-analysis-matthews-correlation-coefficient"></a>
#### Correlation analysis - Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

MCC is an assessment metric for clustering or binary classification analyses that represents the correlation between the observed (ground truth) and predicted labels. MCC can be directly computed from the [confusion matrix](#confusion-matrix) and returns a value between -1 and 1.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="correlation-analysis---kendall"></a>
#### Correlation analysis - Kendall
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Similar to the [Pearson correlation coefficient](#correlation-analysis-pearson), Kendall's tau measures the degree of a monotone relationship between variables, and like [Spearman's rho](#correlation-analysis-spearman), it calculates the dependence between ranked variables, which makes it feasible for non-normal distributed data. Kendall tau can be calculated for continuous as well as ordinal data. Roughly speaking, Kendall's tau distinguishes itself from Spearman's rho by stronger penalization of non-sequential (in context of the ranked variables) dislocations.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="correlation-analysis---pearson"></a>
#### Correlation analysis - Pearson
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Pearson correlation coefficient is probably the most widely used measure for linear relationships between two normal distributed variables and thus often just called "correlation coefficient". Usually, the Pearson coefficient is obtained via a [Least-Squares fit](#least-squares-fit) and a value of 1 represents a perfect positive relation-ship, -1 a perfect negative relationship, and 0 indicates the absence of a relationship between variables.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="correlation-analysis---spearman"></a>
#### Correlation analysis - Spearman
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Related to the [Pearson correlation coefficient](#correlation-analysis-pearson), the Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) measures the relationship between two variables. Spearman's rho can be understood as a rank-based version of [Pearson's correlation coefficient](#correlation-analysis-pearson), which can be used for variables that are not normal-distributed and have a non-linear relationship. Also, its use is not only restricted to continuous data, but can also be used in analyses of ordinal attributes.

<br>
<br>




<a class="mk-toclify" id="cosine-similarity"></a>
#### Cosine Similarity
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Cosine similarity measures the orientation of two *n*-dimensional sample vectors irrespective to their magnitude. It is calculated by the dot product of two numeric vectors, and it is normalized by the product of the vector lengths, so that output values close to 1 indicate high similarity.

<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="cost-function"></a>
#### Cost function
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A cost function (synonymous to loss function) is a special case of an [objective function](#objective-function), i.e., a function that is used for solving optimization problems. A cost function can take one or more input variables and the output variable is to be minimized. A typical use case for cost functions is parameter optimization.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="cross-validation"></a>
#### Cross-validation
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Cross-validation is a statistical technique to estimate the prediction error rate by splitting the data into training, cross-validation, and test datasets. A prediction model is obtained using the training set, and model parameters are optimized by the cross-validation set, while the test set is held primarily for empirical error estimation.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="cross-validation-k-fold"></a>
#### Cross-validation, K-fold
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

K-fold cross-validation  is a variant of [cross validation](#cross-validation) where contiguous segments of samples are selected from the training dataset to build two new subsets for every iteration (without replacement): a new training and test dataset (while the original test dataset is retained for the final evaluation of the predictor). 

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="cross-validation-leave-one-out"></a>
#### Cross-validation, Leave-One-Out
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Leave-One-Out cross-validation a variant of [cross validation](#cross-validation) one sample is removed for every iteration (without replacement). The model is trained on the remaining N-1 samples and evaluated via the removed sample (while the original test dataset is retained for the final evaluation of the predictor). 

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="cross-validation-random-sampling"></a>
#### Cross-validation, Random Sampling
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Cross-validation via random sampling is a variant of [cross validation](#cross-validation) where random chunks of samples are extracted from the training dataset to build two new subsets for every iteration  (with or without replacement): a new training and test dataset for every iteration (while the original test dataset is retained for the final evaluation of the predictor). 



<br>
<br>


<a class="mk-toclify" id="curse-of-dimensionality"></a>
#### Curse of dimensionality
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

For a fixed number of training samples, the curse of dimensionality describes the increased error rate for a large number of dimensions (or features) due to imprecise parameter estimations.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="data-mining"></a>
#### Data mining
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A field that is closely related to machine learning and pattern classification. The focus of data mining does not lie in merely the collection of data, but the extraction of useful information: Discovery of patterns, and making inferences and predictions. Common techniques in data mining include predictive modeling, clustering, association rules, and anomaly detection.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="dbscan"></a>
#### DBSCAN
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

DBSCAN is a variant of a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies core points as regions of high-densities based on their number of neighbors (> *MinPts*) in a specified radius (&epsilon;). Points that are below *MinPts* but within &epsilon; are specified as border points; the remaining points are classified as noise points.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="decision-rule"></a>
#### Decision rule
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A function in pattern classification tasks of making an "action", e.g., assigning a certain class label to an observation or pattern.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="decision-tree"></a>
#### Decision tree classifier
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Decision tree classifiers are tree like graphs, where nodes in the graph test certain conditions on a particular set of features, and branches split the decision towards the leaf nodes. Leaves represent lowest level in the graph and determine the class labels. Optimal tree are trained by minimizing Gini impurity, or maximizing information gain.

<a class="mc-toclify" id="density-dased-clustering"></a>
#### Density-based clustering
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

In density-based clustering, regions of high density in n-dimensional space are identified as clusters. The best advantage of this class of clustering algorithms is that they do not require apriori knowledge of number of clusters (as opposed to [k-means](#k-means-clustering) algorithm).

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="descriptive-modeling"></a>
#### Descriptive modeling
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Descriptive modeling is a common task in the field of [data mining](#data-mining) where a model is build in order to distinguish between objects  and categorize them into classes - a form of data summary. In contrast to [predictive modeling](#predictive-modeling), the scope of descriptive modeling does not extend to making prediction for unseen objects.
<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="distance-metric-learning"></a>
#### Dimensionality reduction
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Dimensionality reduction is a data pre-processing step in machine learning applications that aims to avoid the [curse of dimensionality](#curse-of-dimensionality) and reduce the effect of overfitting.  Dimensionality reduction is related to [feature selection](#feature-selection), but instead of selecting a feature subset, dimensionality reduction takes as projection-based approach (e.g, linear transformation) in order to create a new feature subspace.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="distance-metric-learning"></a>
#### Distance Metric Learning
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Distance metrics are fundamental for many machine learning algorithms. Distance metric learning - instead of learning a model - incorporates estimated relevances of features to obtain a distance metric for potentially optimal separation of classes and clusters: Large distances for objects from different classes, and small distances for objects of the same class, respectively.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="distance-euclidean"></a>
#### Distance, Euclidean
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Euclidean distance is a distance measure between two points or or vectors in a two- or multidimensional (Euclidean) space based on Pythagoras' theorem. The distance is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared pair-wise distances of every dimension.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="distance-manhattan"></a>
#### Distance, Manhattan
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Manhattan distance (sometimes also called Taxicab distance) metric is related to the Euclidean distance, but instead of calculating the shortest diagonal path ("beeline") between two points, it calculates the distance based on gridlines. The Manhattan distance was named after the block-like layout of the streets in Manhattan.

<a class="mc-toclify" id="distance-minkowski"></a>
#### Distance, Minkowski
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Minkowski distance is a generalized form of the Euclidean distance (if *p=2*) and the Manhattan distance (if *p=1*).

<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="eager-learners"></a>
#### Eager learners
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Eager learners (in contrast to [lazy learners](lazy-learners)) describe machine learning algorithms that learn a model for mapping attributes to class labels as soon as the data becomes available (e.g., [Decision tree classifiers](#decision-tree-classifier) or [naive Bayes classifiers](#naive-bayes-classifier)) and do not require the training data for making predictions on unseen samples once the model was built. The most computationally expensive step is the creation of a prediction model from the training data, and the actual prediction is considered as relatively inexpensive.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues"></a>
#### Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Both eigenvectors and eigenvalues fundamental in many applications involve linear systems and are related via *A&middot;v = &lambda;&middot;v* (where *A* is a square matrix, *v* the eigenvector, and &lambda; the eigenvalue). Eigenvectors are describing the direction of the axes of a linear transformation, whereas eigenvalues are describing the scale or magnitude.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mc-toclify" id="ensemble-methods"></a>
#### Ensemble methods
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Ensemble methods combine multiple classifiers which may differ in algorithms, input features, or input samples. Statistical analyses showed that ensemble methods yield better classification performances and are also less prone to overfitting. Different methods, e.g., bagging or boosting, are used to construct the final classification decision based on weighted votes.

<a class="mc-toclify" id="evolutionary-algorithms"></a>
#### Evolutionary algorithms
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Evolutionary algorithms are a class of algorithms that are based on [heuristic search](#heuristic-search) methods inspired by biological evolution in order to solve optimization problems.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="exhaustive-search"></a>
#### Exhaustive search
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Exhaustive search (synonymous to brute-force search) is a problem-solving approach where all possible combinations are sequentially evaluated to find the optimal solution. Exhaustive search guarantees to find the optimal solution whereas other approaches (e.g., [heuristic searches](#heuristic-search)) are regarded as sub-optimal. A downside of exhaustive searches is that computational costs increase proportional to the number of combinations to be evaluated.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="expectation-maximization-algorithm-em"></a>
#### Expectation Maximization algorithm - EM
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) is a technique to estimate parameters of a distribution based on the [Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)](#maximum-likelihood-estimates-mle) that is often used for the imputation of missing values in incomplete datasets. After the EM algorithm is initialized with a starting value, alternating iterations between expectation and maximization steps are repeated until convergence. In the expectation step, parameters are estimated based on the current model to impute missing values. In the maximization step, the log-likelihood function of the statistical model is to be maximized by re-estimating the parameters based on the imputed values from the expectation step.

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="feature-selection"></a>
#### Feature Selection
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Feature selection is an important pre-processing step in many machine learning applications in order to avoid the [curse of dimensionality](#curse-of-dimensionality) and [overfitting](#overfitting). A subset of features is typically selected by evaluating different combinations of features and eventually retain the subset that minimizes a specified [cost function](#cost-function). Commonly used algorithms for feature selection as alternative to [exhaustive search](#exhaustive-search) algorithms include sequential selection algorithms and genetic algorithms

<br>
<br>

<a class="mk-toclify" id="feature-space"></a>
#### Feature Space
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

A feature space describes the descriptive variables  that are available for samples in a dataset as a *d*-dimensional Euclidean space. E.g., sepal length and width, and petal length and width for each flower sample in the popular Iris dataset.

#### Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Fuzzy C-Means is a soft clustering algorithm in which each sample point has a membership degree to each cluster; in hard (crisp) clustering, membership of each point to each cluster is either 0 or 1. Fuzzy C-Means considers a weight matrix for cluster memberships, and minimizes sum squared error (SSE) of weighted distances of sample points to the cluster centroids.

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The abbreviation "iid" stands for "independent and identically distributed" and describes random variables that are independent from one another and are drawn from a similar probability distribution. Independence means that the probability of one observation does not affect the probability of another variable (e.g., time series and network graphs are not independent).  One popular example of iid would be the tossing of a coin: One coin toss does not affect the outcome of another coin toss, and the probability of the coin landing on either "heads" or "tails" is the same for every coin toss.

#### Rejection sampling

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Rejection sampling is similar to the popular [Monte Carlo sampling](#monte-carlo-simulation) with the difference of an additional bound. The goal of rejection sampling is to simplify the task of drawing random samples from a complex probability distribution by using a uniform distribution instead; random samples drawn from the uniform distribution that lie outside certain boundary criteria are rejected, and all samples within the boundary are accepted, respectively.

#### Resubstitution error
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The resubstitution error represents the classification error rate on the training dataset (the dataset that was used to train the classifier). The performance of a classifier cannot be directly deduced from resubstitution error alone, but it becomes a useful measure for calculating the [generalization error](#generalization-error).

#### Rule-based classifier

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Rule-based classifiers are classifiers that are based on one or more "IF ... THEN ..." rules. Rule-based classifiers are related to decision trees and can be extracted from the latter. If the requirements for a rule-based classifier (mutually exclusive: at most one rule per sample; mutuallyy exhaustive: at least one rule per sample) are violated, possible remedies include the addition of rules or the ordering of rules.

#### Sensitivity

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Sensitivity (synonymous to [precision](#precision-and-recall)), which is related to [specificity](#specificity) -- in the context of error rate evaluation -- describes the "True Positive Rate" for a binary classification problem: The probability to make a correct prediction for a "positive/true" case (e.g., in an attempt to predict a disease, the disease is correctly predicted for a patient who truly has this disease). Sensitivity is calculated as (TP)/(TP+FN), where TP=True Positives, FN=False Negatives.

#### Sharding

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Sharding is the non-redundant partitioning of a database into smaller databases; this process can also be understood as horizontal splitting. The rationale behind sharing is to divide a database among separate machines to avoid storage or performance issues that are related to growing database sizes.

#### Silhouette Measure (clustering)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Silhouette measure provides a metric to evaluate the performance of a clustering analysis. For each data point *i*, it measures the average distance of point *i* to all other points in the same cluster *(a(i))*, and the minimum distance to points from other clusters *(b(i))*. The average silhouette measures for each cluster can provide a visual way to pick the proper number of clusters.

#### Simple Matching Coefficient

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The simple matching coefficient is a similarity measure for binary data and calculated by dividing the total number of matches by the total number of attributes. For asymmetric binary data, the related [Jaccard coefficient](#jaccard-coefficient) is to be preferred in order to avoid highly similar scores.

#### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is linear algebra technique that decomposes matrix ***X*** into  
***U D V<sup>T</sup>*** where ***U*** (left-singular vectors) and ***V*** (right-singular vector) are both column-orthogonal, and D is a diagonal matrix that contains singular values. [PCA](#principal-component-analysis) is closely related to the right0singular vectors of SVD.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="soft-classification"></a>
#### Soft classification

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

The general goal of a  [pattern classification](#pattern-classification) is to assign 
a pre-defined class labels to particular observations. Typically, in (hard) classification, only one class label is assigned to every instance whereas in soft classification, an instance can have multiple class labels. The degree to which an instance belongs to different classes is then defined by a so-called membership function.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="specificity"></a>
#### Specificity

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Specificity (synonymous to [recall](#precision-and-recall)), which is related to [sensitivity](#sensitivity) -- in the context of error rate evaluation -- describes the "True Negative Rate" for a binary classification problem: The probability to make a correct prediction for a "false/negative" case (e.g., in an attempt to predict a disease, no disease is predicted for a healthy patient). Specificity is calculated as (TN)/(FP+TN), where TN=True Negatives, FP=False Positives.

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (also see [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent)) is a machine learning algorithm that seeks to minimize an objective (or cost) function and can be grouped into the category of linear classifiers for supervised learning tasks. In contrast to [Batch Gradient Descent](#batch-gradient-descent), the gradient is computed from a single sample.

#### Support Vector Machine

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

SMV is a classification  method that tries to find the hyperplane which separates classes with highest margin. The margin is defined as the minimum distance from sample points to the hyperplane. The sample point(s) that form margin are called support vectors and eventually establish the SVM model.

#### Term frequency and document frequency

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Term frequency and document frequency are commonly used measures in context of text classification tasks. Term frequency is the count of how often a particular word occurs in a particular document. In contrast, document frequency measures the presence or absence of a particular word in a document as a binary value. Thus, for a single document, the document frequency is either 1 or 0.

#### Term frequency - inverse document frequency, Tf-idf
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Term frequency - inverse document frequency (Tf-idf) is a weighting scheme for [term frequencies and document frequencies](#term-frequency-and-document-frequency) in text classification tasks that favors terms that occur in relatively few documents. The Tf-idf is  calculated as a simple product of [term frequency](#term-frequency-and-document-frequency) and the inverse document frequency, and the latter is calculated is calculated by log("number of documents in total" / "number of documents that contain a particular term").

#### Tokenization
[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Tokenization, in the context of natural language processing (NLP) is the process of breaking down a text into individual elements which can consist of words or symbols. Tokenization is usually accompanied by other processing procedures such as stemming, the removal of stop words, or the creation of n-grams.

<a class="mk-toclify" id="whitening-transformation"></a>
#### Whitening transformation

[[back to top](#table-of-contents)]

Whitening transformation is a normalization procedure to de-correlate samples in a dataset if the covariance matrix is not a diagonal matrix. Features are uncorrelated after "whitening" and their variances are equal unity, thus the covariance matrix becomes an identity matrix.
