# Useful libraries for data science in Python

This is not meant to be a complete list of all Python libraries out there that are related to scientific computing and data analysis -- printed on paper and stacked one on top of the other, the stack could easily reach a height of 238,857 miles, the distance from Earth to Moon.

However, I would still be looking forward to additions and suggestions.
