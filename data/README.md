These data were obtained from Robert Dawson, Saint Mary's University, E-mail. The variables are `pclass`, `age`, `sex`, `survived`. These data frames are useful for demonstrating many of the functions in Hmisc as well as demonstrating binary logistic regression analysis using the Design library.

The class labels in the 5th column where replaced by integers 1-4, where 

- 1 = Iris-setosa
- 2 = Iris-versicolor
- 3 = Iris-virginica
